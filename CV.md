## Introduction

- Dublin based Software Engineer and Scrum Master with experience building systems that operate at very large scale while providing fine grained information to users. Additionally, I have experience driving Agile processes in a team and together with other teams in the wider organisation.

- Passionate about building strong teams and building great software together.

## Career

### July 2019 to Present - Veritas Technologies LLC Dublin, Ireland - Senior Software Engineer: EV.Cloud

### _January 2018 to July 2019_ - **Veritas Technologies LLC Dublin, Ireland** - Software Engineer: EV.Cloud

- Delivered a portal for resellers to see information about their customers. Ensuring they understand what their usage is. A new javascript grid implementation, and backend code to aggregate the data for the table was developed.
- Delivered reports and notifications to ensure that customers will not be surprised by any changes in their usage. A data aggregation strategy was needed to enable these reports to be computed quickly.

- Delivered highly desired changes for customers using the E-Discovery product. This included leading the implementation of a feature to allow querying a customer's index using Lucene Query Syntax. To do this a significant addition to the search backend were as necessary. A large number of javascript bugs were fixed and significant missing functionality was added as part of this effort.

- Assisted in moving a very large SAS email archiving service from an on premiss data center to Azure. Once the transition was complete I assisted in reducing the costs of running the service by more than 60%. This involved analysing performance and load on machines and right-sizing them or merging roles onto a single machine.

- Worked on the integration of an internal classification engine into EV.Cloud this allows the customer to search their archived content by what type of data they have and gain insight into where they might have issues with regulatory compliance. A custom proxy was needed to integrate the classification configuration page with the rest of the system securely.

### _January 2017 to November 2017_ - **Veritas Technologies LLC Reading, UK** - Software Engineer: EV
